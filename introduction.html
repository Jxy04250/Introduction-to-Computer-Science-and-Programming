		<p class='special' >
		As smartphones become peopleâ€™s primary cameras to take photos, the quality of their<br />
		cameras and the associated computational photography modules has become a de facto <br />
		standard in evaluating and ranking smartphones in the consumer market. We conduct so far <br />
		the most comprehensive study of perceptual quality assessment of smartphone photography. <br />
		We introduce the Smartphone Photography Attribute and Quality (SPAQ) database, consisting <br />
		of 11,125 pictures taken by 66 smartphones, where each image is attached with so far the <br />
		richest annotations. Specifically, we collect a series of human opinions for each image, <br />
		including image quality, image attributes (brightness, colorfulness, contrast, noisiness, <br />
		and sharpness), and scene category labels (animal, cityscape, human, indoor scene, landscape, <br />
		night scene, plant, still life, and others) in a well-controlled laboratory environment. <br />
		The exchangeable image file format (EXIF) data for all images are also recorded to aid deeper <br />
		analysis. We also make the first attempts using the database to train blind image quality <br />
		assessment (BIQA) models constructed by baseline and multi-task deep neural networks. The <br />
		results provide useful insights on how EXIF data, image attributes and high-level semantics <br />
		interact with image quality, how next-generation BIQA models can be designed, and how better <br />
		computational photography systems can be optimized on mobile devices.
